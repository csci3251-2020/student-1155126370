# Introducing myself
## As a developer
I  learned some **HTML**, **CSS**, and a little bit **Javascript** and **JQuery** when I was doing my ICT SBA during high school *(I was taking elective C: multimedia)*. I can also use **C** and **Java** because I learned them in CUHK. But I have never done my own project apart from school assignments and projects. I have no idea what to do. I hope I can find something to make in this summers. 

## My experience in GitHub
I'm new to GitHub. I just created my first GitHub account because of this coure. When doing the project milestone 1, I found that the GitHub learning lab is quite interesting. I'm interested in taking more courses on GitHub learning lab after I've finished all my assignments and term paper and exams this term.

## Something I want to do in this summer
* Take the GitHub learning lab courses
* Learn Python
* Learn Live2D
* Draw a picture to celebrate Christmas _(I must do this in summer lol because I don't think I have much time to draw after September)_
* Learn more about Hong Kong history
* Tidy up the files on my laptop. It's too messy
